P_Saturday = 550.\nQ_Sunday = Q_Friday/3. \nQ_Saturday = 12\nQ_Friday = Q_Saturday*2 = 12*2 = 24\nQ_Sunday = Q_Friday/3 = 24/3 = 8\nQ_Thursday = Q_Friday/2 = 24/2 = 12\nQ_Wednesday = Q_Thursday*4 = 12*4 = 48\nP_Saturday = 5.50\nP_Wednesday = P_Saturday*3/2 = 5.50*3/2 = 8.25\nP_Thursday = P_Saturday/2 = 5.50/2 = 2.75\nP_Friday = P_Wednesday/3 = 8.25/3 = 2.75\nSpent on Wednesday: 48 * $8.25 = $396.00\nSpent on Thursday: 12 * $2.75 = $33.00\nSpent on Friday: 24 * $2.75 = $66.00\nSpent on Saturday: 12 * $5.50 = $66.00\nTotal except Sunday: $396.00 + $33.00 + $66.00 + $66.00 = $627.00\nSpent on Sunday: $627.00 - $561.00 = $66.00\nPrice on Sunday: 66.00 / 8 = $8.25\n#### 8.25"}
